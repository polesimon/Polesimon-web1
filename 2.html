  Connie Talbot (born 20 November 2000) is a British singer who reached the final of the first series of Britain's Got Talent in 2007. Although she had never taken singing lessons, her initial performance drew international press coverage. She signed with Rainbow Recording Company, and her debut album, Over the Rainbow, was released in the UK in November 2007. The album was re-released in June 2008 with a new track listing, along with its first single, a cover of Bob Marley's "Three Little Birds". Over the Rainbow reached number one in three countries, and has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide. Since the initial album release, Talbot has performed publicly and on television in Europe and the US, as well as across Asia, where her music had gained recognition through YouTube. Three more albums by Talbot were released between 2008 and 2012: Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, Holiday Magic and Beautiful World. (Full article...)
